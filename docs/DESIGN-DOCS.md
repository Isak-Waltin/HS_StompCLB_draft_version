# Ode To A Star: Design Docs



#### Theme/Setting/Genre

Comparison of lifestyles/Different towns and locations/Role-playing game (RPG)



#### Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief

- Conversations/friendships
- Exploration of towns and different areas
- Several minigames that gate progression
  - They'll work sort of like longer micro-games from the WarioWare franchise



#### Targeted Platforms

- Hopscotch
  - Mobile devices
  - PC
    - Possibly a PC port from Awesome_E with added keyboard shortcuts



#### Monetization model (Brief/Document)

- Play chapter 1 for free, one-time payment of 25-50 seeds for all additional chapters
  - NOTE: How long will chapter 1 be? We may want to ask for payment earlier on so more people actually get to the purchase. Players may stop playing the game altogether around the 10-15 minute mark.
- Donations through the form of mushrooms
- Let's not get greedy and hope to make this project for the best community impact possible.
